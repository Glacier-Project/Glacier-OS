# Glacier OS
Glacier OS is an open-source mobile operating system designed for DIY mobile devices.

## Design Goals
### Portable
- Glacier OS can be ported to new devices easily, requiring very little device-specific code
- Glacier OS supports the Arduino IDE, so DIY phones can be built by anybody without complicated toolchain setup
- New locales are just a header file away

### Hackable
- Simple and easy to understand APIs for all hardware
- Adding new apps takes nothing more than a few dozen lines of code

### Secure & Private
- Encrypted SMS messaging is planned, eliminating the need to trust the modem + cellular network
- Any web services should be privacy-first
- The user should never feel disrespected by their device
