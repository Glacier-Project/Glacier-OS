# TODO

## Documentation
- Comment all code

### System Calls
- Document system calls and their structure

## API
### Filesystem

### Display
- Provide re-usable code (shapes + font rendering) in api.hpp - maybe lift code from arcticOS?

### Communication
- Mobile data

### Permissions
- Store current app permissions in memory
- FS access permission
- Separate system folder permission for FS access
- Cellular calls permission
- Cellular texts permission
- Cellular data permission

### UI
- Create menu UI - maybe lift code from arcticOS?
